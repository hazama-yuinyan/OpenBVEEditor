1.About
   Thank you for downloading!
   OpenBVEEditor is a simple and easy-to-use editor.
   The program is currently designed to edit the OpenBVE Route files, which is a free and great simulator of public transportations, 
   but you can add any functionalities and redistribute it as long as you are following the GNU Public License.
   For more infos on GPL, please see the gpl.txt in the project's root directoty.
   
2.How to compile
   First, you need to have the following libraries installed to compile it.
   1.the Boost libraries
   2.JUCE - a C++ cross-platform library for designing GUIs
   For the instructions on building those libraries, please visit their Web sites at http://www.boost.org/ and http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce.php.
   
   I have tested compiling it just on the VC++ so the other compilers may fail to compile it.
   There are a Makefile, Xcode projects for Mac and iPhone and an android project as well as a VS project included in the project,
   but as I said before I can't garantee that all the projects other than the VS one will be compiled.
   
3.How to use
   Eh...I can't write it down now since the program isn't completed.
